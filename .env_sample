# Username used for the FTP server, and eventually for HTTP as well

# FTP_ADDR sets the address for the FTP server. ":2525" means listening on "0.0.0.0:2525"
# Leaving blank will disable FTP server

# If you're hosting your ddrv to the cloud you must open these ports in order for FTP to work properly.
# Defines the range of ports that can be used for passive FTP connections
# Enabling this option will enable PASV mode. Due to which if your ISP doesn't support port forwarding ddrv won't work.
# FTP_PORT_RANGE=45000-50000

# HTTP_ADDR sets the address for the HTTP server.
# Leaving blank will disable HTTP server
HTTP_ADDR=:2526

# Discord webhook URLs. Use this for sending attachment messages to Discord channels.
# Can have multiple URLs separated by commas
# Note:  Multiple webhooks in one Discord channel won't increase your rate limit, they'll share the same limit.
#        To avoid rate limit issues, create one webhook for each different channel.
WEBHOOKS=

# Defines the maximum size (in bytes) of chunks to be sent via Discord webhook.
# You should probably never touch this and if you do  don't set it to more than 25MB,
# with discord webhooks you can't upload file bigger than 25MB
CHUNK_SIZE=

# Enables concurrent file uploads to Discord, resulting in faster file transfers.
# Note that this will use more RAM, approximately (chunkSize * number of webhooks) + 20% extra bytes.
# Use with caution based on your system's memory capacity.
